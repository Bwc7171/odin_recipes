# odin_recipes
A project that will build a simple recipe website.
The project will give me an opportunity to use HTML coding skills, GitHub repository skills, writing commit messages, and using the terminal to manipulate directories and files.
The strategy behind the project is to build a simple recipe site.  The site will utilize objects like images, links, and ordered and unordered lists. 

Additionally, I will begin making more descriptive and appropriate commit messages.
